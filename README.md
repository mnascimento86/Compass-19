# Compass-19
This is an open-source(.NET CORE, SpringBoot, AI, Mongodb) initiative for a reference book about COVID-19 symptoms into some success cases.
Into this system the doctors will digite his patient scenarios,
and them the system will make a reference list from activities used by recovered patients, 
who should be similars the sick patients. 

We expect pass an information about everything that was made for recover that sick patients and them give a those parameters for doctors.

The main idea is to insert healthy success case-patient and its factors after the system will treat this data using machine learnings to match with more near inputted scenarios system will gonna display the top 10 cases mostly near the case input: Important information displayed is :

Used medicines

Arterial pressure of patients 
Patient Temperature  of patients 
Breath of patients 
The time that patient was in intensive treatments Unity (UTI for Brazil)
