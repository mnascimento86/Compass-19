# Compass-19
This is an open-source(.NET CORE, SpringBoot, AI, Mongodb) initiative for a reference book about COVID-19 symptoms into some success cases.
Into this system the doctors will digite his patient scenarios after that system will make a reference list of recovered patients who did like currently sick patients. 

We expect pass an information about everything that was made for recover that sick patients and them give a those parameters for doctors.

The main idea is to insert healthy success case-patient and its factors after the system will treat this data using machine learnings to match with more near inputted scenarios system will gonna display the top 10 cases mostly near the case input: Important information displayed is :

Used medicines
Uses case
Arterial pressure of patients 
Patient Temperature  of patients 
Breath of patients 
The time that patient was in intensive treatments Unity (UTI for Brazil) 
Age of patients 
Weight of patients 
Height of patients 
Status of patients 
All activities about that patient ( Gym, sports, normal eating food, how is living)
and some other fields required by Healthy doctors (Stakeholders)

Talking about folders:

This project is using microservices three tier layer and docker. the main idea is to have a hub API
 to connect another app client-sides (mobile, pwa, desktops, web and external softwares)
